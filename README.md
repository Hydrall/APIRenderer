# APIRenderer
A custom module for Drupal 7 (with a partly-functional version built for Drupal 8) created to provide customer sites with customizable social media feeds that can be styled to match the website's design, along with providing some storage and caching of these feeds so making an API call each time the page is loaded isn't necessary.
